# Create an Azure Key Vault instance

You will start by creating an Azure Key Vault instance that will host your application secrets. You can use the following guidance to perform this task:

- [Create Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/spring-apps/tutorial-managed-identities-key-vault?tabs=system-assigned-managed-identity#set-up-your-key-vault).

## Step by step guidance

1. From the Git Bash prompt, run the following command to create an Azure Key Vault instance. Note that the name of the service should be globally unique, so adjust it accordingly in case the randomly generated name is already in use. Keep in mind that the name can contain only lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens. The `$LOCATION` and `$RESOURCE_GROUP` variables contain the name of the Azure region and the resource group into which you deployed the Azure Spring Apps service in the previous exercise of this lab.

   ```bash
   KEYVAULT_NAME=kv-$APPNAME-$UNIQUEID
   az keyvault create \
       --name $KEYVAULT_NAME \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --location $LOCATION \
       --sku standard
   ```

   > Wait for the provisioning to complete. This might take about 2 minutes.
